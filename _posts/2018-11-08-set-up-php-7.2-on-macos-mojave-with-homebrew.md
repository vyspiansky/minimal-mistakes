To check the version of PHP in the terminal, type the following command:

```bash
php -v
```

or can see what versions of PHP are installed with 

```bash
brew list | grep php
```

Maybe it’s worth cleaning up some of the old packages from brew. It's up to you.

Make sure brew is up to date:

```bash
brew update
brew upgrade
```

Let’s finally install 7.2 version of PHP

```bash
brew install php@7.2
```

If you need to have this version of PHP first in your `PATH` run the following command:

```bash
echo 'export PATH="/usr/local/opt/php@7.2/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.bash_profile
echo 'export PATH="/usr/local/opt/php@7.2/sbin:$PATH"' >> ~/.bash_profile
source ~/.bash_profile
```

And the result?

```bash
php --version
```

Where is a php.ini file?

Your .ini file is located in `/usr/local/etc/php/7.2/php.ini`. To check just type

```bash
php --ini
```

How to install extensions?

PHP extensions have been removed and now should be installed from `PECL`:

```bash
pecl install xdebug
```
